I am a lecturer in space geodesy in the Department of Civil, 
Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE) at University College London 
(UCL) with research interests in astrodynamics and space debris dynamics for
orbit prediction and orbit determination, and also, in various aspects of 
global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and related technologies. If you're still reading (:+1:) and want to know more, have a look at my {{% staticref "files/Bhattarai_S_CV_Nov2019.pdf" "newtab" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}}. I teach Mathematical Modelling and Analysis to first and second year undergraduates in the [MEng in Engineering and Architectural Design Programme](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/programmes/undergraduate/engineering-and-architectural-design-meng) and contribute to teaching on various modules in CEGE. Please reach out if you're interested in collaborating!
